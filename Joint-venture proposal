Main Objective
To re-establish a lightning Jukebox that will directly compensate an artist with SATS anytime a piece of music is played.

Problem Statement
Native music artists as creators of content in Lesotho and across the globe get nothing for their music that is subjected to copyright infringement, 
they only rely on entrance fees to live shows or performances to make ends meet.

Vision
Global Mass Bitcoin Adaptation

Modus Operandi
The proposed lightning Jukebox will perform as follows, artist will have a privilege to upload music on Motipi Music Streaming data base in specific folder based on Genre , for example , under the artist folder ,
albums will be categorized by release dates, 
if it’s a new track it will fall under new releases, if it’s a hit song it will fall under the trending folder, 
it is important to note that each artist will have to have an Lnbits wallet attached to the music folder for a direct payment to occur before the  track can be played,
every time a fan selects a track he/she wishes to play, a lightning wallet QR code linked to the artist has to popup once the play button is clicked, when scanned and payment confirmed then the track should play, 
when another fan wishes to play another artist song , the same process occurs but instead of the track automatically playing it will queue in the playlist for the playing song to end, 
in order to make the Jukebox experience fun , 
another cool feature used by Pleb-FM should be added , where fans can manipulate the playlist by bidding using SATS for which song to play first, 
the highest bidder’s song will play next, huge rewards for the artist. The sky's the limit to how far intellectual property owners can benefit with this project, 
a fan gets a multiple-choice whether to listen to a track or watch a  music Videos of their favorite  artist,
reference Elements Lightning Jukebox , 
that feature will demand extra SATS  for that extra effort. 
We propose using our own database to manage local artists' music on our platform instead of the spotify API.

Conclusion

Motipi Music Streaming platform proudly brings together all the parties involved in the Lightning Jukebox for a nonprofit venture that will virtually meet the fan with an artist, 
no middle-man, Lnbits Multiple wallets, Pleb-FM’s Bidding feature, and Elements Music Video approach.When the power of love overcomes love for power, 
the world will be a better place, May God Bless.
