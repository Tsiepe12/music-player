This system requires system credentials to access all of the data and functionalities of the Motipi music streaming system.

How the System Works
Motipi music streaming has a registration form on the Login Page by clicking the "Create New Account". After creating a new account, the system will automatically login to the new subscriber using his/her created credentials. On the "Home Page", the summary numbers of all Genres, Playlist, Songs, Subscriber, Subscriber's Uploaded Songs, and Subscriber's Created Playlist. The Genre page can only be managed by the Admin users which makes the subscribers read the Genre's Details and listen to songs uploaded filtered into the viewed or selected genre. The Playlist Page is the page where the user view, create and manage the playlist. The system navigates to each page without refreshing the window so the music doesn't stop when redirecting other pages.
